# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
My name is Mahisha which means Shining Moon ðŸŒ™

## Interests
I am particularly interested in the intersection of data science, economics, and finance. Financial systems are inherently complex, characterized by numerous interdependent parameters that significantly influence their behavior. Many classical models often fall short, either failing to capture the intricacies of these systems or providing only partial insights. I am eager to leverage recent advancements in applied mathematics and computer science, such as Deep learning and Bayesian methods, to study and engineer financial systems.

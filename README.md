# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
My name is Mahisha which means Shining Moon 🌙

## Interests
I am particularly interested in the intersection of data science, economics, and finance. Financial systems are inherently complex, characterized by numerous interdependent parameters that significantly influence their behavior. Many classical models often fall short, either failing to capture the intricacies of these systems or providing only partial insights. I am eager to leverage recent advancements in applied mathematics and computer science, such as Deep learning and Bayesian methods, to study and engineer financial systems.

## A Quick Guide to My GitHub 🚀

In my GitHub repositories, I explore various facets of machine learning, deep learning, and their applications in economics and finance:

### Basic ML 
This repository covers introductory topics in Machine Learning theory, including Linear and Logistic Regression, Regularization, and Cross-Validation. It serves as a great starting point for those new to the field and looking to build a solid foundation.

### [Bayesian Machine Learning](~/Bayesian-Machine-Learning)
Here, I showcase an alternative approach to machine learning that focuses on inferring probability distributions instead of relying solely on point-wise estimations. This repository contains Bayesian implementations of Linear and Logistic Regressions. The accompanying READMEs provide a good introduction to Bayesian methods, and the visualizations included can be quite enjoyable to explore!

### Deep Learning
This repository documents my journey in learning about deep neural networks. The codes here are more complex and may require some prior familiarity with the topic. However, the READMEs are thorough, and I've included some engaging visualizations that I highly recommend checking out!

### Economics Related Codes
In several repositories within my GitHub, I focus on modeling financial systems and tackling various problems in the field. For instance, I've worked on modeling stock price volatility in a way that accounts for rare events using Bayesian methods. Additionally, I've implemented deep neural networks within a Geometric Brownian motion framework to predict stock prices. One of my favorite projects involves using neural networks to predict the likelihood of a company's bankruptcy and exploring whether certain strategies could potentially prevent it!
